        <li>it's composable</li>
        <li>Products built with React are easy to scale </li>
        <li>
          Data in React only flows one way, from parent components to their
          children. This makes it easier to track how data changes and fix
          problems
        </li>
        <li>
          React can be easily integrated with other frameworks and libraries
        </li>
