## ReactDOM 
- it act like a Bridge between the Your React Component and Browser DOM
- And allowing you to render your React elements onto a web-page by providing methods to Manipulate
- its the key component for connecting React's Virtual DOM to the real DOM, enabling smooth updates and performance optimizations.
- example 
   ReactDOM.render(element, selected element );

   ## Why React 
   - it's composable
   -  React allows developers to create components that can be used in multiple places, saving time and effort
   - genarally in web-devlopement have more repeated/boilore plate code (its fine with but if we wanna change any change i have to manually in every single page and place)
   - but when we use the react it help here a lot we gonna write a same on a component we reuse at multiple place when we need change that one change can refected to all apages where you use that component.
   - Products built with React are easy to scale 
   -  Data in React only flows one way, from parent components to their children. This makes it easier to track how data changes and fix problems.
   - React is easy to test with little or no configuration. Developers can use tools like Jest and Enzyme to write tests quickly
   - React can improve SEO performance by reducing website load time and enabling search engine crawlers to properly index a page
   - React can be easily integrated with other frameworks and libraries. 
   - React has a large ecosystem of open-source libraries
   - React has developer tools, browser extensions, and JSX syntax to help developers improve efficiency and productivity.
   - React's virtual DOM can reduce rendering time by up to 50% compared to traditional methods. It also allows developers to update components without having to update the entire DOM
   -  React Native allows developers to create apps for both web and mobile.
